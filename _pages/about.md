I am a passionate PhD Student in Physics at the Johannes Gutenberg Universit√§t Mainz, dedicated to unraveling the complexities of our universe. My research journey is rooted in the fields of Experimantal Partical Physics, Real Time Data Acquisition and Machine Learning, with a focus on developing solutions that can handle the vast amounts of data generated by scientific experiments today.

The core of my research lies in experimental particle physics, particularly through my involvement with the [Mu3e](https://www.psi.ch/en/mu3e) Experiment. This cutting-edge project, designed to search for the rare decay of the muon (`$$ \mu^+) \rightarrow e^+ + e^+ + e^- $$`), is not just a testament to human curiosity but also a significant step towards understanding the fundamental laws that govern our universe.

My work extends beyond the boundaries of physics, venturing into the field of algorithmic fairness. This domain is where ethics meets technology, challenging us to design and implement algorithms that are not only efficient but also equitable. I am an associate member of the [TOPML](https://topml.uni-mainz.de/) project, which studies the interaction of non-functional properties in machine learning.
